## 💻 Automated API Test Summary: Adjutor API (Lendsqr)

This document outlines the goal, methodology, setup, and execution commands for the automated API testing project targeting the Nigerian Country Specific Endpoints of the Adjutor API.

### 1. Project Goal and Scope

The primary objective is to create automated test scripts for the Adjutor API endpoints to ensure they meet functional, data integrity, and security requirements.

| Element | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Goal** | Achieve automation coverage for a minimum of two critical API endpoints per functional module within the Nigerian Country Specific Endpoints folder. |
| **Tooling** | Postman Desktop (Test Case Development), Newman (CLI/CI Execution), npm (Script Orchestration). |
| **Assertions** | Comprehensive validation covering **HTTP Status Codes**, **Data Types**, **Business Logic**, and **Security** (data masking). |

### 2. Methodology and Assets

The testing pipeline is configured for command-line execution, ensuring compatibility with Continuous Integration (CI) environments.

| Asset Type | Location/Link | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Source Code (Repository)** | [https://github.com/Understandingvictor/AUTOMATED-TEST-TASK-BY-LENDSQR](https://github.com/Understandingvictor/AUTOMATED-TEST-TASK-BY-LENDSQR) | Contains `package.json`, test scripts, collection, and environment files. |
| **Postman Collection (Development)** | [Postman Collection Link](https://www.postman.com/victor-2746354/workspace/victor/collection/45370484-3c161506-e753-4930-a840-0f7fa565d3e7?action=share&creator=45370484&active-environment=45370484-c53fc43e-3aff-4ba9-9065-c6a65ce75872) | Reference for test scripts and API definitions. |
| **Test Runner** | Newman (CLI) | Enables command-line execution and reporting. |
| **Reporting** | `newman-reporter-htmlextra` | Generates a user-friendly HTML report for quick analysis. |

### 3. Setup and Execution Instructions

The project requires **Node.js** to be installed to manage dependencies and execute test commands.

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the project to your local machine:


git clone [https://github.com/Understandingvictor/AUTOMATED-TEST-TASK-BY-LENDSQR.git](https://github.com/Understandingvictor/AUTOMATED-TEST-TASK-BY-LENDSQR.git)
cd AUTOMATED-TEST-TASK-BY-LENDSQR


**Step 2: Install Dependencies**
npm install


#### Step 3: Run Tests

Execute tests using the custom scripts defined in `package.json`.

|**Command**  | **Description** |**Purpose**
|---|---|---|
|`npm run test-report`|Runs all tests, generates the HTML report, **and automatically opens the report in your default browser.**| **Full Automation / Primary Test Command**
|`npm run test-terminal`|Runs all tests and displays the full results summary directly in the command line/terminal.|Quick Validation
|`npm run report`|Opens the latest generated HTML report from a previous test run.|Report Review
|`npm run test-silent`|Runs the tests quietly and generates the HTML report file in the `/newman` folder, without opening the browser.|CI/Background Execution

### 4. High-Level Test Case Summary

The comprehensive test cases, including detailed assertions for status codes, data types, business logic, and security (masking), are encapsulated within the Postman collection.

The full, summarized results and granular assertion status for all endpoints can be viewed in the **GUI report** generated by the ***npm run test-report*** command.
